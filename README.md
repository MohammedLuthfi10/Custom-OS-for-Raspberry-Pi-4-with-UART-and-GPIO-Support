# Project: Custom OS for Raspberry Pi 4 with UART and GPIO Support

## Project Overview
Expand your ongoing OS development project for **Raspberry Pi 4** by adding **UART** and **GPIO** support. Start from the basics of OS development using the [raspberry-pi-os repository](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os), and then implement drivers for UART and GPIO.

## Goals
- Create a minimalistic OS with custom **UART** and **GPIO** drivers.
- Enable the system to interact with external hardware (e.g., LED blink using GPIO, display messages over UART).
- Document the OS boot process, the UART initialization, and how you integrated GPIO control from scratch.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Set Up Development Environment
- Clone the [raspberry-pi-os repository](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os).
- Set up a cross-compilation environment for Raspberry Pi using **GCC** for ARM.

### 2. Implement UART Driver
- Initialize the UART peripheral for communication.
- Create functions for sending and receiving data via UART.
- Use UART for debugging and displaying messages during boot.

### 3. Implement GPIO Driver
- Initialize GPIO pins for input and output.
- Create functions to control GPIO pins (e.g., setting pin high/low).
- Implement an example to blink an LED using GPIO.

### 4. Boot Process Documentation
- Document the OS boot process, explaining how the system initializes and configures UART and GPIO.
- Include details on how to compile and run your OS on the Raspberry Pi 4.

### 5. Basic Shell Implementation (Optional)
- Implement a simple shell that interacts with users via UART.
- Allow users to execute commands to control GPIO or display messages.

## Additional Ideas
- Use UART for debugging purposes throughout the OS development.
- Add more features to the shell for better interaction with hardware.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates your OS development knowledge, familiarity with low-level hardware programming, and embedded systems expertise.

## Tools and Software Used
- **GCC** for ARM for cross-compilation.
- **Raspberry Pi 4** for testing and deployment.
- **Raspberry Pi OS** for development environment.
